Welcome to the 8th ASESMA.
ASESMA 2025, also known as the 8th African School on Electronic Structure Methods
and Applications (smr 4081), is a premier event that brings together emerging scientists
and leading researchers in the field of computational materials science.
The 2025 edition will focus on modern approaches to electronic structure calculations, 
including density functional theory, pseudopotentials, and ab initio molecular dynamics.
